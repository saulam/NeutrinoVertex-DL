Description: This script defines a custom Lambda learning rate scheduler for warm-up phase.
             It also defines a custom learning rate scheduler, CombinedScheduler, which combines two
             existing schedulers typically used for training deep learning models.
             It is designed for scenarios where you want to start with a warm-up phase using one scheduler
             and then transition to another scheduler for more fine-grained control over learning rate annealing.
             The CombinedScheduler takes an optimiser and two existing schedulers as input. It switches between
             the two schedulers after a specified warm-up period. Additionally, it provides the option to decay
             the learning rate after every restart.
